permalink: /what/
content: Ontologies are structured and standardised descriptions of things in the world that can be used to give meaning to data, to organise evidence and knowledge, and to serve as a hub for community-wide discussions that aim to advance theory and the cumulative progress of scientific research. Widely used in the biosciences, they are beginning to be adopted in the behavioural and social sciences.
